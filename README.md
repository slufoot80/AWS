3) Configure Subnets and VPC Networking:
Demonstrate the ability to identify and configure a NAT Gateway, Demonstrate the ability to identify and create public subnets,Demonstrate the ability to identify and create private subnets, Demonstrate the ability to configure subnet networking using given requirements

4) Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):
Demonstrate the ability set up users and groups, and to protect your resources with access control policies. Also how to connect to other identity services to grant external users access to your AWS resources.

5) Introduction to VPC: 
This lab will walk you through the primary components of the VPC so you can understand how they work together to create secure AWS environments. You will create public and private subnets and learn the differences between them.

6) Building a Three Tier Network VPC From Scratch in AWS:
Hands-on experience building and connecting the following components inside AWS:
VPC's, Subnets, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, Nat Gateway, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs). These components are the foundation of highly available/fault tolerant networking architecture inside of AWS, and cover concetps such as infrastrucutre, design, routing, and security.
